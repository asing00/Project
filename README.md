For this project I downloaded the latest data set of Covid-19 infections from https://ourworldindata.org/

I then cleaned the data, and imported into a database I hosted on my local machine

From there using the SQL queries of which I have attached a copy for documentation, produced a visualization of my results.

The visualizations were then produced using Tableau.
